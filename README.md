# OptimalControlProblem - solution of the Cauchy problem by the Euler method
Analyzed the optimal control problem to understand what solution to strive for.
Outputted text file contains the program's running time, the number of iterations, the value of the functionality.
Two animations: changing the method steps of the phase variable trajectory plots versus time and changing the control plots versus time.
